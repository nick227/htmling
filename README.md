## ABOUT

Have you ever really wanted to read something online but the page is very long and you are tired of scrolling? Addressing that is currently the only practical application for this script. Potentially it could be used to templatize any list or type of html content.  This service strips tags from submitted or retrieved html and then applies a template to the returned content. Currently the demo provides two templates, kindle and default. Built off <a href="https://github.com/jgoodall/restify-base">restify-base</a>.

Demo uses webscraping at: http://htmling.herokuapp.com/


## USAGE

1. run npm install
2. run node server.js
3. verify port is available
